# Focus Coaching Implementation Plan - PROMPT ENHANCEMENT ONLY

## Overview
Enhance existing AI coaching prompts in the Pomodoro system to incorporate focus coaching accountability questions without adding new features or command options.

## Current State Analysis - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Existing Pomodoro System**: `/pomodoro coach` with motivation and reflection types
- ✅ **AI Coaching Service**: `aiCoachingService.ts` with existing prompt methods
- ✅ **Thread Integration**: Coaching messages sent to dedicated pomodoro threads  
- ✅ **User Profiles**: Coaching style preferences already working

## SIMPLIFIED Implementation Plan - PROMPT UPGRADE ONLY

### 1. Enhance Existing Reflection Prompt
**File**: `src/features/pomodoro/aiCoachingService.ts`
**Method**: `buildReflectionPrompt()`
- Upgrade existing reflection prompt to include focus coaching questions
- NO new coaching types added
- NO new commands or options added
- Uses existing `/pomodoro coach type:reflection` command

### 2. Focus Coaching Questions Integration
**Questions to integrate into reflection prompt**:
- "Do you have what you should report to your manager?"
- "What's your question about this task?"
- "What's your barrier or obstacle about this task?"
- "When will you finish this task?"
- "What do you have the list of these tasks in this project?"
- "What work remains to be done?"

### 3. No Interface Changes
- ✅ **Existing Commands**: Keep `/pomodoro coach type:reflection` unchanged
- ✅ **Existing Types**: No changes to CoachingMessage types
- ✅ **Existing Options**: No new command options added

### 4. Leverage Existing Infrastructure
- **Thread System**: Use existing thread creation and message delivery
- **User Profiles**: Utilize current coaching style preferences  
- **Session Management**: Build on existing pomodoro session tracking
- **AI Integration**: Use established OpenAI service integration

## Files to Modify - MINIMAL CHANGE

### Single File Change:
- `src/features/pomodoro/aiCoachingService.ts` - Enhance `buildReflectionPrompt()` method only

### No Changes Needed:
- ❌ `src/features/pomodoro/types.ts` - Keep existing types unchanged
- ❌ `src/features/commands/pomodoro.ts` - Keep existing command options
- ❌ No new files needed

## Enhanced Question Logic Flow - EXISTING COMMANDS ONLY

1. **Existing Session**: User has active pomodoro session running
2. **Existing Command**: User runs `/pomodoro coach type:reflection` (unchanged)
3. **Enhanced Prompt**: AI now uses improved reflection prompt with focus coaching questions
4. **Smart Question Selection**: AI selects 1-2 most relevant accountability questions:
   - Manager reporting readiness
   - Task clarification needs  
   - Obstacle identification
   - Timeline expectations
   - Project task inventory
   - Remaining work assessment
5. **Thread Delivery**: Enhanced reflection questions delivered to existing pomodoro thread
6. **User Response**: User can respond directly in thread for follow-up coaching

## Testing Approach - MINIMAL

### Unit Tests:
- ✅ Update existing `aiCoachingService.test.ts`
- Update test cases for enhanced reflection prompt
- Verify improved question generation
- NO new test files needed

### Manual Testing:
- Start pomodoro session: `/pomodoro start`
- Request reflection coaching: `/pomodoro coach type:reflection` (unchanged command)
- Verify enhanced focus coaching questions appear in pomodoro thread
- Test with different coaching styles (encouraging/neutral/challenging)
